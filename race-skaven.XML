			<p>Whether sniveling in fear, cackling with mad laughter, or snarling in a fury, skaven are wretched and inconsequential—at least in the eyes of most other folk. In their own minds, though, they are content to lurk in the shadows only until they fully come into their own and receive the recognition they believe they deserve. They are entitled to some credit for their tenacity, agility, crafty ingenuity, and dumb luck, all of which has enabled them to survive in a world overrun with creatures larger and more powerful than they are. They are cowardly but dasterdly, unforgiving, and relentless as well.</p>
			<h4>SMALL AND FURY</h4>
			<p>Standing around 3 feet tall and covered in dirty brown fur, Skaven have huge snouts and ears. Their wiry bodies are surprisingly strong. and their mouths are full of sharp, crooked teeth.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most goblins have patchy fur and have their pale-pink skin showing through, either by heredity or by losing hair through burns, but a few boast shocks of white or black hair.  Many goblins prefer to go unshod to leave their feet and hands exposed for climbing and burrowing.</p>
			<h4>UNFETTERED EMOTION</h4>
			<p>Creatures of raw impulse and ambition, Skaven are found among guilds that value that quality. Many goblins are guildless and make their way as members of street gangs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sometimes driven by wild mood swings, Skaven have an inclination toward destruction, which can take a playful form but is often anything but. Some Skaven clobber things, others like to light them on fire, and many love to blow things up.</p>
			<p class="indent">Skaven have an outrageous sense of humor, usually expressed through mischievous pranks. The malicious among them find pleasure in the misfortune of others and tend to cackle maniacally whenever they’re amused. They can act with apparent randomness, sometimes just to confuse and befuddle others.</p>
